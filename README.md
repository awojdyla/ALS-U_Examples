# ALS-U_Examples

This repository contains a series of files that were used to demonstrate the capabilities of [OASYS](https://www.elettra.trieste.it/oasys.html) through scripting and widgets, and were used by [Luca Rebuffi](https://github.com/lucarebuffi) during a hands-on tutoral given at the ALS in March 2018 to provide real life examples on how these could be used to model ALS-U beamlines, the fourth generation synchrotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. 

Questions relative to these scripts should be adressed to [Antoine Wojdyla](https://github.com/awojdyla/)

## How to use python scripts

## How to read a file and generate a source by resampling

The initial profile ws generated using xoppy (which itself call SRW)

## Creating a source based on SRW calculation




## Example were HYBRID fails


## Scanning and looping

`scanning_ellipse_shape.py` and 
`scanning_vls_ruling_density`

in action: 
`Looping and Scanning variable via Python scripts`

They all have been integrated as standalone widget into [Shadow ALS utility](https://github.com/lucarebuffi/OASYS1-ALS-ShadowOui)
